# Linear-Data-Structures-Comparison

This experiment compares the performance of three data structures — **Python's built-in lists**, **singly linked lists**, and **doubly linked lists** — when searching for words. The experiment uses a list of the **1000 most common English words**.

For each data structure, the project measures:

- **Insertion time** – time to load all words into the structure  
- **Search time** – time to search for a randomized subset of words  

The goal is to observe and compare the efficiency of these common linear data structures.

## Project Structure

- `linear_search_vs_linked_lists.py` – main Python script  
- `1000-most-common-words.txt` – input file with 1000 common words  
- `results.pdf` – charts showing insertion and search time comparisons  

---

## Usage

1. Place `1000-most-common-words.txt` in the same folder as the script.  
2. Run the script
```bash
python linear_search_vs_linked_lists.py
```
